## About

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lfproQC R package is to provide an optimal combination of normalization and imputation methods for the label-free proteomics expression dataset. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of lfproQC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kabilansbio/lfproQC", build_manual = TRUE, build_vignette = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example for finding the best combinations of normalization and imputation method for the label-free proteomics expression dataset:

```{r example}
library(lfproQC)
## basic example code with the example dataset and data groups
yeast <- best_combination(yeast_data, yeast_groups, data_type = "Protein")
yeast$`Best Combinations`
```

**The overall workflow for using the 'lfproQC' package**
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/IARI_NEW DELHI/M.Sc/Paper/Final_R/R_package/lfproQC/vignettes/images/flow1.png")
```
